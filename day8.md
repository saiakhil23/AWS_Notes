**1. What is elasticity ?**

Increasing or Decreasing the **Number** of servers based on the Demand.
-  Elasticity is a short term and it can achieved in AWS using AUTO-SCALING
-  Elasticity is also called as **Horizantal Scaling**
-  AUTO-SCALING = **Scale Out** and **Scale In**

> **Note:** Uses the same capacity(cpu and ram) of servers in auto scaling. 
   
   
 **2. What is Scalability ?**

Increasing the **Capacity** of the servers is called the Scalability.
- Scalability is also called as **Vertical Scaling**
- Scalability is Long Term
- Scalability = **Scale Up** and **Scale Down**

**How do you acheive Zero Downtime in AWS ?**
We can acheive Zero Downtime by using ASG
